- Create Worker route. Need to test further to make sure it works, then need to get rid of edge cases/formatting (e.g. phone number format, etc.).

Important Later:
- Implement Mongoose remove middleware to remove workers/participants associated with a user when the user is removed: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14349259


Small Stuff:
- Update new user password verify so that it verifies on front end prior to form submission
- Password reset via email


Future Ideas
- Allow users to upload a profile picture
- Allow users to reset password via security question
